This widget displays different feed links depending on which page is displayed.

== Description ==

Contextual Feed Widget displays links to different RSS feeds depending on which page is displayed. For example, a category page will link to the feed for that category. On a single post, it will link to the feed for that post's comments. 

Through the customizer, you can add your own text (or HTML code) to the beginning of the widget. You can use this to explain what the feed links are, or you can leave it blank.

The widget will use [Dashicon](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/) code by default, which is built into WordPress and used by many themes. If your theme doesn't use Dashicons, or you'd rather use other icons instead, then you're free to remove or change the code through the customizer.

Need a new feature or found a bug? Get involved! You can submit an issue or pull request at the plugin's [git repository](https://github.com/johnridesabike/Contextual-Feed-Widget).
